# Django URL Permissions

A Django package that provides a flexible and efficient way to manage URL-based permissions through Django's user groups. This package allows you to control access to specific URLs based on user group membership and HTTP methods.

## Features

- üîí Control access to URLs based on user groups
- üåê Support for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc.)
- ‚ö° Option to grant all-method access with a single permission
- üîå Easy integration through middleware
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable exempt URLs
- üêç Support for Django 3.2+ and Python 3.7+
- üë®‚Äçüíº Built-in admin interface integration
- üöÄ Efficient database querying with proper indexing

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install django-url-permissions
```

## Quick Start

1. Add 'django_url_permissions' to your INSTALLED_APPS:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_url_permissions',
]

```

2. Add the middleware to your settings:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...
    'django_url_permissions.middleware.UrlPermissionMiddleware',
]
```

3. Configure optional settings:

```python
# URLs that don't require permission checks
URL_PERMISSION_EXEMPT_URLS = [
    '/admin/',
    '/login/',
    '/static/',
    '/media/',
]

# Global switch to enable/disable permission checks
URL_PERMISSION_REQUIRED = True
```

4. Run migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

## Usage

There are two ways to implement URL permissions in your project:

1. **Global Permission Check** (Recommended for new projects)
   
   Set in your settings.py:
   ```python
   URL_PERMISSION_CHECK_ALL_VIEWS = True
   ```
   This will enforce URL permissions on all views automatically (except exempt URLs).

2. **Decorator Approach** (For selective permission checking)
   
   If `URL_PERMISSION_CHECK_ALL_VIEWS = False`, you can use the decorator to specify which views require URL permissions:
   ```python
   from django_url_permissions import url_permission_required
   from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
   from django.shortcuts import render

   @url_permission_required
   @login_required
   def my_view(request):
       return render(request, 'my_template.html')
   ```

Note: The order of decorators matters. `@url_permission_required` should be placed before `@login_required` to ensure the user is authenticated before checking URL permissions.

In both cases, you'll need to configure the permissions for each group through the Django admin interface.

## Managing URL Permissions

URL permissions are managed through the Django admin interface, similar to model permissions:

1. Go to Django admin (`/admin/`)
2. Navigate to "Groups"
3. Create or edit a group
4. In the group edit page, you'll find a "URL Permissions" section below the standard model permissions
5. Use the interface to:
   - View available URL permissions
   - Add/remove URL permissions for different HTTP methods
   - Filter URLs using the search box
   - Choose multiple permissions at once

Users will only be able to access URLs that their groups have been granted permission to access.


### Supported HTTP Methods

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE
- HEAD
- OPTIONS
- ALL (special permission that grants access to all methods)

## Settings

- `URL_PERMISSION_REQUIRED`: Enable/disable URL permission checking globally (default: True)
- `URL_PERMISSION_EXEMPT_URLS`: List of URL prefixes to exclude from permission checking (default: [])

# Exempt certain URLs from permission checking
URL_PERMISSION_EXEMPT_URLS = [
    '/admin/',
    '/login/',
    '/public/',
